# Mole City Introduction



## What is Mole City?

Mole city is an open source, unmanaged crypto asset lending market protocol.

In the market of Mole City, users can deposit specific crypto assets to earn interest, or pay certain interest to borrow certain crypto assets.

Compared with the pioneers such as Compound and Aave, Mole City will actively create a richer lending market, optimize the execution efficiency of smart contracts, and even expand more dimensions of business logic on the premise of giving priority to capital security.

In addition, we pay great attention to the user experience of global users. We strive to make more improvements in this regard and reduce the learning threshold of users. With the gradual improvement of the protocol, Mole City will build a series of colorful decentralized applications.

In terms of governance, the core development team of Mole City has more positive and responsible considerations. We believe in the importance of goals and basic principles. Projects without souls cannot have high-quality governance. Therefore, in the initial stage of Mole City governance, the core development team will actively participate in the governance of the agreement to guide the community to form an atmosphere of scientific governance. We will discuss the governance framework of the Mole City agreement with all members of the community in the first proposal after the Governance Forum goes online.
